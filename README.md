HTML-Git-CSS Homework
In order to refactor the code to make it easier to read and to ensure it meets accessibility standards, I made the following changes:

1. Replaced divs with semantic tags including header, section, body, aside, and footer
2. Created descriptive title and meta description in header
3. Added alt tags for all images to improve seo and enable accessibility
4. Consolidated css tags including image tags, h2, h3, benefit section content, etc.
